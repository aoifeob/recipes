## Ingredients

* 6 Carrots
* 3 Cloves of Garlic
* 2 Tablespoons of Cumin
* 1 Tablespoon of Smoked Paprika
* 1 Tablespoon of Olive Oil
* A pinch of salt

* Water (as needed)

## Instructions

Peel the carrots and cook them in salted boiling water until tender. Remove from the pot, and submerge them in cold water until they have cooled.

Mash the garlic and mix with the cumin and smoked paprika until the mixture forms a paste. Cut the cooled carrots into small round slices, then mix them with the paste.

Add equal parts apple cider vinegar and water to the carrots until the liquid covers them completely. Allow to marinate in a fridge for 4+ hours. Before serving, drain the liquid, and top with olive oil and salt.
