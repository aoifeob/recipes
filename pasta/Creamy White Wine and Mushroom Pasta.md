## Creamy White Wine and Mushroom Pasta

I recommend serving this dish with a side of [garlic bread](https://github.com/aoifeob/recipes/blob/master/snacks/Garlic%20Bread.md).

This pasta should be reheated on the hob rather than in a microwave, as the high heat of the microwave is likely to cause the cream to split and the sauce to become oily. To reheat over the hob, use a low heat, and loosen the sauce with leftover cream or milk as needed.

#### Serves: 4

#### Prep Time: 5 minutes

#### Cooking Time: 25 minutes

## Ingredients

* 300g Pasta
* 200g Mushrooms
* 200ml Cream
* 100ml White Wine
* 4 Cloves of Garlic
* 1 Onion
* 1 Vegetable Stock Pot/Cube
* 1 Tablespoon of Olive Oil

## Instructions

Finely chop the onion and garlic. Clean and slice the mushrooms.

Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the onion and garlic until the onion is translucent. Add the mushrooms, and stir until they have browned slightly.

Add the wine, and cook until the alcohol has evaporated and the liquid has reduced by half. Stir occasionally to prevent the mushrooms sticking to the pan.

Add pasta to generously salted boiling water and cook over a medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the pasta sticking.

Add the cream and increase the heat to high. Stir in the vegetable stock pot/cube and season with salt and pepper to taste. Once the cream begins to bubble at the edge of the pan, cook for a minute or two further while stirring, and then remove from the heat.

When the pasta is al-dente, drain the pasta, reserving some of the water. Toss the pasta in the sauce, adding pasta water to loosen the sauce as necessary.

Serve with salt and pepper shakers, and season to taste.
