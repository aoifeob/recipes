Recipe Description

#### Serves: 4

#### Active Prep Time: 10 minutes

#### Cooking Time: 35 minutes

## Ingredients

* 1tbsp neutral oil
* 250g chestnut mushrooms
* 3 cloves of garlic
* A pinch of salt
* 2tbsp soy sauce
* 100g cashew nuts
* 1tsp cumin
* A pinch of smoked paprika
* A pinch of black pepper
* 300g puff pastry
* 20ml milk (or non-dairy milk)

## Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 180C fan / 200c conventional.

Chop the mushrooms and mince the garlic.

Heat the oil in a pan and fry the mushrooms, garlic, and salt until the liquid from the mushrooms has evaporated and the mushrooms are beginning to brown. Add the soy sauce and cook for a further minute.

Transfer the mixture to a food processor, and add the cashews, cumin, smoked paprika, and pepper. Blend until the mixture comes together - the cashews and mushrooms should be slightly larger than grains of granulated sugar.

Roll out the puff pastry, and slice into lines of your desired size. Begin to spread the filling in lines down the puff pastry, making sure to leave enough room to seal the pastry into the filling.

Fold one side of the pastry over the filling, then brush that side with milk. Fold the other side of the pastry over the top. Repeat until all of the lines have been folded, then chop each line into rolls of your desired size.

Pierce the bottom of each roll once or twice (depending on size) with a knife, then place on a baking tray and brush with more of the milk.

Bake until golden brown, approx 20-25 minutes.
