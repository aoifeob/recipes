## Ingredients

* 1 tbsp neutral oil
* 1 large onion
* 1 large sweet potato
* 4 cloves of garlic
* A thumb-size piece of ginger
* 1tsp cumin
* 150g dried red lentils
* 400ml coconut milk
* 800ml vegetable stock
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

Slice the onion. Roughly chop the sweet potato into small cubes. Mince the garlic and ginger. 

Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Fry the onion until soft and transluscent. Add the sweet potato, garlic, ginger, and cumin to the pan and cook until fragrant - approx 2 minutes.

Rinse the lentils until bubbles no longer appear in the water. Add the lentils to the saucepan and stir to coat. Add the coconut milk and simmer for 2 minutes. Then add the vegetable stock to the pan.

Simmer until the sweet potato is tender, then blitz the soup with a hand blender until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
