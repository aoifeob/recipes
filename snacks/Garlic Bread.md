#### Active Prep Time: 5 minutes
#### Cook Time: 2 minutes

## Ingredients

* 50g Butter
* 3 Garlic Cloves
* 2 Sprigs of Fresh Parsley (optional)
* 1 Bread Roll

## Instructions

Allow the butter to soften at room temperature for a couple of hours in advance.

Finely chop the garlic cloves and parsley, if using. Scatter the garlic and parsley evenly over the chunk of butter, then mash everything together with a fork.

Slice a bread roll into 1.5 inch thick diagonal slices, slicing from top to bottom. Stop cutting the bread just before slicing all the way through. Spread the butter between the slices, and grill for 1-2 minutes until the butter has melted into the bread.
